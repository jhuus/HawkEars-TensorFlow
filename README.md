# HawkEars
By [Jan Huus](https://github.com/jhuus)

## Introduction
HawkEars is a desktop program that scans audio recordings for bird sounds and generates Audacity label files. It is inspired by [BirdNET](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET), and intended as an improved productivity tool for processing field recordings. This repository includes the source code and a trained model for a list of species found in northeastern North America. The complete list is found in the file data/classes.txt. The repository does not include the raw data or spectrograms used to train the model.
